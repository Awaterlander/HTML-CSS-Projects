#The above code accomplished the following:
#Created a button element.
#Utilized the ID attribute and assigned the paragraph element the value “Irish.”
#Returned the paragraph element by calling the “Irish” value that we assigned earlier (when writing the ID attribute).
#Everything inside our curly brackets { } is our function.
